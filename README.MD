This program is designed to read and display optical spectrum data from a USB4000 Spectrometer made by Ocean Optics, Inc.  This program is still in develpment, so only a few, basic features are supported.

### **Requirements**
A [Java JDK or JVM](https://www.java.com/en/) or [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net) version 8, or later must be installed in order to run the code.  There is also a [**Runnable JAR file**](https://github.com/wholder/RglComm/blob/master/out/artifacts/RglComm_jar) included in the checked in code that you can download and run without having to compile the source code.

## Credits
USB4000 uses the following Java code to perform some of its functions, or build this project:
- [Usb4Java](http://usb4java.org) is used to perform the low-level USB I/O that talks to the USB4000.
- [IntelliJ IDEA from JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (my favorite development environment for Java coding. Thanks JetBrains!)
